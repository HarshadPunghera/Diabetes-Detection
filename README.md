**Diabetes Detection using Neural Network**

Problem Definition: To detect whether a patient is likely to have Diabetes based on other contributing factors. (Binary Classification)

Steps Taken:
-Loading the data for exploration and visualization. 
-Building the structure of network.
-Compiling the model, specifying loss function, metrics, and optimizer (which includes the learning rate).
-Fitting the model on training data (specifying batch size, number of epochs)
-Predicting on new data
-Evaluating results
